                    I am an individual with a passion for learning. To me, nothing is more exciting than struggling
                    through a problem and finding that breakthrough solution. While studying Mechatronics Engineering
                    at the University of Waterloo, I have been presented with countless opportunities to do so.
                    Collaborations with classmates has led to my introduction into several interesting areas, including
                    Web Development, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning.

                    <br><br>

                    Outside of the classroom, I use my time to
                    develop skills in these areas. Machine Learning is a field in which I have spent a significant
                    amount of time. From watching video lectures, reading articles, and learning the mathematics behind
                    model training, I have become competent in the area and an active practitioner.

                    <br><br>

                    In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, going on runs, and playing several recreational
                    sports (golf, tennis, soccer).

                        During my time at the NRC, I worked on a project that uses Machine Learning to forecast sea
                        ice presence in several large Canadian bodies of water. ML models incorporate
                        <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04214" target = "_blank">ConvLSTMs</a> and a
                        custom SIF-Net RNN architecture. For input, they take bitmaps of several environmental
                        conditions (e.g. precipitation, temperature, windspeed).

                        <br><br>

                        My contributions included adding to the existing model training pipeline and deploying final
                        products to AWS. I conducted rigorous experimentation with model inputs and
                        hyper-parameters to maximize performance. I wrote code for the deployment of the project to
                        AWS; using <a href = "https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/" target = "_blank">Fargate</a>, ice
                        presence forecasts are generated each day and available for viewing on a
                        static webpage that I developed.

                        <br><br>

                        I wrote a work term report, summarizing my contributions; this report is available via the

                        As a Machine Vision Support Engineer at Vista, I was responsible for developing Machine Learning
                        solutions for projects where traditional methods of Machine Vision could not perform at a
                        level required by the client. I worked on several projects during my co-op. I spent a
                        majority of my time carrying an Object Detection project to completion.

                        <br><br>

                        I was also responsible for training Vista Engineers and providing an introduction to Neural
                        Networks. I delivered a webinar presentation that introduced the general structure of Neural
                        Networks, the mathematics behind model training, and how these concepts can be implemented
                        into their custom applications.

                        <br><br>

                        I on-boarded Vista Employees with my work, prior to my departure, and trained the incoming
                        co-op student. I was requested for continual support related to Vista's Machine Learning
                        projects.

                                        The goal of this project is to build a Mini Cart, powered by a
                                        <a href = "https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target = "_blank">Raspberry Pi</a>,
                                        that can take directions without direct human intervention. A camera is mounted
                                        to the front of the cart chassis. Pictures are taken and processed through a
                                        Machine Learning algorithm to extract instructions.

                                        Instructions include: 'go left', 'go right', 'go forwards', 'stay'. After a proof
                                        of concept is acquired, speed controls will be added. The user simply has to
                                        point in the direction of travel and the Mini Cart responds appropriately.

                                        When working at the NRC, I was asked to develop a method by which end users could
                                        access final products. Ice presence forecasts needed to be generated daily
                                        and available for download. I pioneered and finished the complete deployment
                                        pipeline of the project.

                                        Using docker, I containerized the application and pushed
                                        the image to AWS. I then leveraged the flexibility of

                                        scheduled tasks run daily and products are automatically uploaded to AWS s3. A

                                        approach. Through the use of OpenAI Gym's environment, I am given control of the cart.
                                        The cart can move either left or right. My task is to determine, given a 4D vector
                                        [Position, Velocity, Angle, Angular Velocity], the action that will maximize the
                                        probability that the pole does not fall over, both in short and long term.

                                The Mini Cart is designed to follow directions without pre-programmed instructions.
                                The end user can simply point in the desired direction of travel and the robot will
                                react accordingly. Computer Vision and Machine Learning are used to determine

                                A custom camera mount was built and installed on the front of the mini cart.

                                A simple CNN was implemented to generate predictions. One issue specific to this project
                                was model size. It was impossible to load the original model (~400MB) into memory on the
                                Raspberry Pi; this is a common problem for ML 'at the edge'. Several steps were taken to
                                reduce the model size to ~2MB. The model was quantized to use float16 precision (from
                                float32). The model was further compressed using
                                <a href = "https://www.tensorflow.org/lite" target = "_blank" style = "color: black">Tensorflow Lite</a>.

                                In addition, images from the dataset were resized to 256 by 256 images (from 512 by 512).
                                This decreased the size of convolution layer outputs and number of parameters in dense
                                layers later in the network.

                                I created my own dataset, gathering approximately 400 images of myself pointing in
                                various directions. There was a 80 / 20 percent split of training and validation images,
                                respectively. On the validation set of 80 images, an eventual accuracy of 88% was
                                achieved.

                                The goal of this project was to develop a policy the CartPole can follow so that it stands upright. At each
                                time step, OpenAI Gym provides the cart's position, angle, velocity, and angular velocity. It is our
                                job to use this information to determine what action should be taken that will maximize the
                                probability that the CartPole remains standing upright. Possible actions are moving left or right.

                                <h3>Approach</h3>

                                <p>
                                    Reinforcement Learning was used to solve this problem. This concept is synonymous to
                                    positive/negative reinforcements in real life:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <i>If a dog behaves, they receive a treat; if they misbehave, you put them in their cage.
                                         After time, the dog figures out what is considered good/bad behaviour
                                        based off of the consequences.
                                    </i>
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This approach can be used to our advantage when training AI. The reinforcement learning application
                                    consists of four entities:
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The environment (OpenAI Gym / Your house)</li>
                                    <li>The agent (CartPole / The dog)</li>
                                    <li>The action space (Move left or right / Behave or misbehave)</li>
                                    <li>The reward (Number / Give treat or put in cage)</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p>
                                    The approach for solving this problem is the following: train the CartPole to take actions that
                                    maximize its reward.
                                </p>

                                <h4>How is the network trained?</h4>

                                <p>
                                    For a given state, it is the network's job to output a vector of probabilities for taking each
                                    action in the action space. When training, we attempt to minimize the difference between that output
                                    and the action that maximizes rewards.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    For example, if the CartPole is currently travelling to the left, it is preferable to
                                    reverse that movement and begin travelling to the right. Thus, a desired output from the model is [0, 1]
                                    ([Going left, Going right]). A network without training won't necessarily generate that output.
                                    The optimizer's job is to adjust the network so that the vector approaches [0, 1] when the CartPole
                                    is moving left.
                                </p>

                                <h4>So our loss function attempts to minimize that difference. How are rewards used?</h4>

                                <p>
                                    We multiply our gradients by the rewards. When performing Back Propagation, positive rewards
                                    (agent did something right) will cause the optimizer to descend down the gradient. The
                                    opposite is true for negative rewards (agent did something wrong). This process has the effect of
                                    'learning' what the appropriate actions to take are, given a state from the environment.

                                <h4>The Credit Assignment Problem</h4>

                                <p>
                                    There is a fundamental problem with how rewards are calculated: how does the agent know if
                                    falling at t = 100 was caused by an action at t = 98 or t = 17? This is known as the 'Credit
                                    Assignment Problem'.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To solve this problem, we apply a discount rate to our rewards. For each time step:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <i>
                                        Discounted Reward [t = t] = Reward [t = t] * pow(discount_rate, 0) + ... + Reward [t = t + n]
                                        * pow(discount_rate, n)
                                    </i>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Note: discount_rate belongs to (0, 1)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    What does this accomplish? This decreases the impact that a future reward has on the current time
                                    step. Using discounted rewards, the agent, over many games, is able to 'learn' what actions,
                                    given a corresponding input from the environment, are beneficial.
                                </p>

                                    The tf.keras API was leveraged for the formulation of models. Each model architecture developed
                                    consisted of a series of fully-connected layers. Dropout was used for the final design; this
                                    design performed the best during testing.

                                    After 5 iterations of the model architecture, a policy model was trained that converged and
                                    was able to survive in the environment. The program was manually
                                    stopped at 15,000 steps (about 5 minutes). It took 900 episodes of training to reach this point.

                                            Machine Learning was used to solve this problem. Using the tf.keras API, a Convolutional
                                            Neural Network was trained on the MNIST dataset. The following model architecture was
                                            used.

                                            Thanks to Google, I was able to train on a state-of-the-art TPU (Tensor Processing Unit)
                                            through their free cloud service: Google Colab. On the MNIST dataset, I reached a
                                            validation accuracy of approximately 99.2%.

                                            It is important to note that the
                                            numbers of the MNIST dataset are written in pen, while we are using an HTML
                                            canvas to draw our numbers; this could slightly impact model performance.
